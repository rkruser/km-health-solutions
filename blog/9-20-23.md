# Entrepreneurial tech blog

The goal of this blog is to record daily thoughts and project ideas as I devise them and work on them. This allows me to build on past ideas and integrate them into the project consistently.

Vivek's code assistant messages:

Also, before I forget, here are the low code/no code development software platforms: Appian, Mendix, Airtable, Zapier, Quickbase, Pega, Make, Kissflow, Nintex, and Coda to name a few. There are a ton out there but I think these are the best for what we're looking for from my perspective at least. I think Mendix and Make are the best. Quickbase might also be good. I will leave the one you choose up to you but I recommend starting with Make. Factors I considered in picking these platforms were exportability of code, integration/API flexibility, ability to work well with database data formats, ability to grow in a serverless manner, HIPPA compliance, and ability to integrate with AI and blockchain technologies. I can always go into more detail if you want over the phone or via message here.
