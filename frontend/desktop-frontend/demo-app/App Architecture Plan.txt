App Architecture Plan

1. FHIR bridge
2. State model for app with fewest possible points of maintenance
3. Server/database service
4. Define patient types in extensible way
5. Define functionality goals in detail
6. Write this up as an official spec to send to Vivek (Microsoft Word is good enough, don't waste time with latex right now)
