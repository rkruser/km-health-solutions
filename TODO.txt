GENERAL (as of 6/15/23):

- Looks like Electron is the way to go for the desktop GUI
- Docker might be good for use in the backend cloud services, further research needed
- TODO: devise work pipeline on cloud server

DETAILED TODO (as of 6/15/23):
- Transplant web interface to electron app
- Make sure it works in a minimal sense
- Package it and see if Vivek can install it on his laptop


- Figure out EMR API and database scheme

- Figure out which free cloud server to use and pricing
- See if I can use chatGPT for patient data

- Tree summarizing scheme plus info verification protocol (plus estimates of API calls per patient)
- Decision matrices + causal trees + formal verification schemes to integrate with AI (wolfram alpha as tool to help?)
